## Learning Activities & Resources

The focus of Week 5's practical was to implement a minimum of 6 visible customizations to the website. Here are the details of the style changes I made:

**Thicker Underlines & Red Links on Hover:**

Increased the thickness of underlines (text-decoration-thickness: 1.5px) and adjusted their position (text-underline-offset: 0.15em) for better visibility and alignment.

**Aqua Text Color:**

Switched the colour of most text to blue (colour: aqua) for a calming and distinct appearance.

**Bigger Text:**

Increased the font size of the main text on the website (font-size: 32px) to enhance prominence and readability.

**Light Beige Background:**

Set the background colour to a soft, light beige (background-color: bisque) to create a subtle backdrop complementing the overall design.

## Estimated Hours

The task consumed me approximately a day.

## Content Insights

The website's stylistic changes surpassed simple adjustments in colours and sizes, aiming strategically to enhance the user experience. Thicker underlines and vibrant hover colours acted as visual highlights, engaging users in navigation. Larger text directed attention to crucial details, and consistent, vibrant link colors served as markers for seamless navigation. The subtle light beige (bisque) background elevated the overall experience without overshadowing the content, aligning with the commitment to creating an appealing and user-friendly platform.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights

While refining the website's style, I delved back into CSS concepts using w3schools. Although my career may not predominantly involve front-end or back-end development, familiarizing myself with these concepts enriches my overall comprehension of website design. Despite these aspects not being my primary focus, they play a role in cultivating a well-rounded skill set, offering a broader viewpoint on website deployment. This ongoing learning process boosts my adaptability and contributes to a more thorough understanding of web development.
