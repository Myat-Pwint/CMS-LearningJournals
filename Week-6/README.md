## Estimated Hours

Our team conducted a series of four meetings to complete the practical task, with each meeting lasting approximately 30 minutes. In total, I invested approximately 2 hours in the entire process, which included time spent on installing and configuring project management tools. The overview of our meeting sessions in written under the content insights.

## Content Insights

Throughout this practical, my focus was on learning the essentials of opening WordPress and creating an account via the localhost installation. The process encountered challenges, primarily related to file name changes during unzipping and conflicts with other database applications running simultaneously. After watching tutorial videos and engaging in discussions with classmates facing similar issues, a solution was found by identifying and stopping conflicting applications in the Windows "services" software. This allowed the creation of a new database in phpMyAdmin, establishing a connection with WordPress.

#First Meeting Summary: Business Idea Ideation and Project Planning

During our inaugural meeting, the team commenced the project with introductions and role assignments based on individual strengths. The primary focus was on establishing a clear business objective. Through a collaborative ideation session, we delved into various concepts, employing tools like SWOT analysis and affinity mapping to structure our ideas. By the meeting's end, we developed a comprehensive understanding of our business goal, acknowledging both challenges and opportunities.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights

This practical experience underscored the significance of problem-solving skills in web development. Overcoming installation challenges enhanced my troubleshooting abilities and strengthened the importance of community support and shared experiences. As I progress, I plan to incorporate this problem-solving mindset into my approach, understanding that overcoming technical challenges is a fundamental aspect of becoming proficient in web development tools. The insights gained this week will guide me in efficiently addressing similar challenges in future projects and platforms.
