# Learning Journal - Practical 6

## Learning Activities & Resources

This week, our team progressed in the group project setup. I initiated the integration of WordPress and Joomla into our development environment, following comprehensive tutorial videos on YouTube and consulting official documentation.


## Estimated Hours

The task consumed approximately 1 and half hours of my time. I encountered challenges during the WordPress installation process, which required troubleshooting.

## Content Insights

Throughout this practical, my focus was on learning the essentials of opening WordPress and creating an account via the localhost installation. The process encountered challenges, primarily related to file name changes during unzipping and conflicts with other database applications running simultaneously. After watching tutorial videos and engaging in discussions with classmates facing similar issues, a solution was found by identifying and stopping conflicting applications in the Windows "services" software. This allowed the creation of a new database in phpMyAdmin, establishing a connection with WordPress.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights

This practical experience underscored the significance of problem-solving skills in web development. Overcoming installation challenges enhanced my troubleshooting abilities and strengthened the importance of community support and shared experiences. As I progress, I plan to incorporate this problem-solving mindset into my approach, understanding that overcoming technical challenges is a fundamental aspect of becoming proficient in web development tools. The insights gained this week will guide me in efficiently addressing similar challenges in future projects and platforms.
