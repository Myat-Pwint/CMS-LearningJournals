**Estimated Hours:**
It took me around 5 hours in total since I had some trouble setting up Joomla but it was solved fortunately in the end. 

**Content Insights:**
This week, I delved into Joomla, focusing on tutorial videos from YouTube and the official Joomla website. I grasped the basics of setting up a Joomla website, understanding its modular structure, and navigating the admin interface. The tutorial videos provided step-by-step guidance on creating pages, managing content, and customizing templates. Additionally, the official documentation on the Joomla website served as a valuable reference, offering in-depth explanations of features and functionalities.

**Career/Employability/Learning Insights:**
Through this learning experience, I realized the importance of comprehensive documentation in mastering a new platform. The combination of video tutorials for a visual understanding and official documentation for detailed information made my learning process smoother. As I explored Joomla's capabilities, I began to realize its potential applications, particularly in tailoring websites for different age groups. This insight will guide my approach to future projects, ensuring a balance between visual learning and thorough documentation exploration. Moving forward, I plan to apply this strategy of combining tutorials and official documentation to enhance my proficiency in other web development tools and platforms.
