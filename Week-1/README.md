**Week 1**

**Business Plan Explanation:**

This website is a one-stop shop for buying clothes, with a focus on trendy fashion inspired by social media. We want to change online shopping by using new features that let users make their own outfits with clothes from our platform. Users can try on clothes from different brands virtually before they buy them. This not only makes shopping more fun, but it also helps users feel sure about their purchases. The virtual fitting room lets users see how the clothes will look on them, so they can make informed decisions. 

In addition to the excitement of trying on clothes virtually, our platform also emphasizes the importance of sustainable fashion. We work with a carefully selected group of sustainable brands to create a marketplace that not only sells clothes but also promotes a more eco-friendly lifestyle. To help users make informed choices, our platform has a transparent rating system. This system shows users how each brand is doing in terms of the environment and ethics, so they can feel good about the clothes they buy.
